    regards,

对方觉得高，你觉得不高

对方：

    The price is on the rather high side, it could be difficult for us to accept it at the price.
    你：I’m a little surprised to hear you say that. Our domain is precious, and we have to consider the prime costs. If you won’t make any concession, we might as well as call the deal off.
